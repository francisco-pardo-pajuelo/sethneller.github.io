# About Me
<p align="justify"> I am a health and applied microeconomist from Searcy, Arkansas. I'll be graduating from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2022 and will be present at the virtual ASSA meetings in January 2022.
  
  
My research primarily focuses on the long-run effects of health shocks, particularly those occuring during childhood. My job market paper investigates the effect of early-life pollution exposure from California wildfires occurring in the mid-20th century in order to better understand how childhood health affects longevity, economic achievement, and disability in mid-to-late adulthood. In other work (with fellow UT-Austin Job Market Candidates Sam Arenberg and Sam Stripling), we investigate how additional Medicaid coverage in late childhood and early adolescence reduces the likelihood of incarceration as adults.

  
In addition to my research in early-life determinants, I am also interested in the determinants of physician practice structure and treatment styles. You can view my <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/research.html">research page</a> for current and upcoming projects. </p>
