#### <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/papers/Medicaid_and_incarceration.pdf">*The Impact of Youth Medicaid Eligibility on Adult Incarceration*</a>

*Joint w/ Sam Arenberg and Sam Stripling*

<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:0.8em"> This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that  increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such declines. We find that reduced incarceration in adulthood substantially offsets the initial costs of expanding eligibility. </p>

#### <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/papers/Practice_structure.pdf">*How Do Medicare Payments Influence Physician Practice Structure?*</a>

<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:0.8em"> This paper exploits spatial discontinuities in Medicare payment rates to estimate the effect of reimbursements on primary care physicians’ choice of organizational structure. I find that a 1 percent increase in Medicare reimbursement leads to a 1.7 to 2.2 percentage point increase in primary care doctors who practice with a small group (defined as 25 providers or fewer). This effect is driven by changes in the tails of the practice size distribution: a 1.8 percentage point increase in physicians who are affiliated with the smallest (1- or 2-provider) practice groups with a corresponding decrease in physicians joining very large practices (≥ 150 providers). I do not, however, detect any evidence of physician sorting or bunching around the boundary in response to differential payment, supporting the underlying assumptions of my regression discontinuity design. Accordingly, my findings suggest that Medicare pricing may be a factor in the trend of consolidation in the physician and clinical services market. </p>

#### *Ashes to Ashes: The Lifelong Consequences of Early-Life Wildfire Exposure [Part of Census RDC Proposal #2272]*

*Joint w/ Sam Arenberg*

<details>
  <summary> Project Summary </summary>
      <p align="justify"> This project will assess the lifelong impact of early-life exposure to air pollution on longevity, disability and economic outcomes in late adulthood. In order to do so, we will link historical California wildfire data to Social Security Administration birth/death records and economic outcomes in the Census/ACS by using restricted data from the Census Bureau. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first paper to assess the effects of air pollution over the entire lifespan when the exposure occurs in utero or during the first year of life.</p>

#### *What is a NICU Worth? Measuring the Returns of Early-Life Healthcare Accessibility [Part of Texas ERC Proposal #119, Texas DSHS Proposal #20-012]*

<details>
  <summary> Project Summary </summary>
      <p align="justify"> This project will assess the educational and labor market returns to neonatal healthcare resources by evaluating the effect of entry and exits of neonatal intensive care units (“NICUs”) in Texas using a differences-in-differences framework. In order to do so, I will link Texas Vital Statistics data from 1986-2004 to longitudinal education and labor market data housed in the Texas Education Research center. This project will build on existing literature by evaluating impacts across a wide variety of neonatal health conditions and by utilizing complementary regression discontinuity and difference-in-discontinuities methods to evaluate changes in the value of medical technology over time and explore mechanisms.</p>
