 <summary> Abstract </summary>
      <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper assesses the impact of in utero and early-childhood exposure to wildfire smoke on longevity as well as economic achievement, human capital accumulation, and disability in mid-to-late adulthood. To identify areas that were exposed to wildfire pollution, we leverage mid-20th century (1930-1969) California wildfires and smoke dispersion modeling. We then combine these wildfire pollution data with comprehensive, restricted-use administrative data from the Social Security Administration and Census Bureau.  These linked data allow us to measure childhood exposure to wildfire smoke for four decades of birth cohorts and to observe a rich set of later-life outcomes including mortality, economic achievement, educational attainment, and disability outcomes. Using this data, we estimate a cohort distributed leads-and-lags regression model, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in smoke exposure in order to identify long-run effects. We find that moving from the 25th to 75th percentile of early-life wildfire smoke exposure results in 1.7 additional deaths before age 55 per 1,000 individuals, conditional on surviving past early childhood. Estimating these effects across ages 30 to 80 translates to 46 life years lost per 1,000 persons. We further find that smoke exposure results in unfavorable changes to a wide range of later-life outcomes across economic achievement, educational attainment, and disability measures. Using these results, we conservatively estimate that each child born in California during our sample period sustained, on average, ~$20,000 of discounted damages in lost life expectancy and lost earnings due to wildfire smoke. These findings suggest that warming temperatures, which exacerbate the duration and intensity of wildfire seasons, is already meaningfully affecting the life cycles of exposed children through increased smoke exposure. </p>

<details>
 <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that  increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such declines. We find that reduced incarceration in adulthood substantially offsets the initial costs of expanding eligibility. </p>

#### <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/papers/Practice_structure.pdf">*How Do Medicare Payments Influence Physician Practice Structure?*</a> 
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> (Under Review) </i></p>

<details>
 <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper exploits spatial discontinuities in Medicare payment rates to estimate the effect of reimbursements on primary care physicians’ choice of organizational structure. I find that a 1 percent increase in Medicare reimbursement leads to a 1.7 to 2.2 percentage point increase in primary care doctors who practice with a small group (defined as 25 providers or fewer). This effect is driven by changes in the tails of the practice size distribution: a 1.8 percentage point increase in physicians who are affiliated with the smallest (1- or 2-provider) practice groups with a corresponding decrease in physicians joining very large practices (≥ 150 providers). I do not, however, detect any evidence of physician sorting or bunching around the boundary in response to differential payment, supporting the underlying assumptions of my regression discontinuity design. Accordingly, my findings suggest that Medicare pricing may be a factor in the trend of consolidation in the physician and clinical services market. </p>

#### *Does a Stitch in Time Save Nine? The Long-Run Effects of Hospital Access [Part of Census RDC Project #2272]* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with Sam Arenberg </i></p>

<details>
 <summary> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This project will study the long-term impacts of childhood hospital access on health, human capital, and economic outcomes in adulthood. To do so, we will leverage variation in childhood hospital access from the Hill-Burton hospital construction program, linked to administrative birth and death records as well as outcomes in the restricted-use Decennial Census and American Community Surveys. Because the Hill-Burton program disproportionately increased hospitals in predominately Black areas, we examine whether these expanded medical resources closed gaps in outcomes among Black Americans. </p>

#### *Air Pollution, Educational Outcomes, and Long-Term Incarceration [Part of Texas ERC Project #155]* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with Anjali P. Verma and Sam Arenberg </i></p>

<details>
 <summary> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> There is now substantial evidence that air pollution negatively impacts student outcomes. However, less is known about the mechanisms, critical periods, and potential long-term consequences of pollution exposure in later childhood and early adolescence. This project will utilize rich longitudinal data from the Texas Educational Research Center on student outcomes and school characteristics, linked with later-life incarceration data to better understand the impacts of air pollution and its later-life outcomes. </p>

#### *How Does Opioid Prevalence Affect Surgery Decisions?* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with David Beheshti </i></p>

<details>
 <summary> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper studies how the prevalence of opioids affects joint physician-patient decisions over medical procedures. Following Alpert et al. (2019), we utilize variation in OxyContin exposure due to state policies that affected OxyContin's marketing and market entry. Preliminary results suggest that higher availability of opioids led to a substantial increase in the number of discretionary surgical discharges (e.g., knee replacements, hip replacements, and back surgeries), but did not meaningfully affect discharges for non-discretionary surgical procedures or medical discharges. </p>

#### *The Later-life Impacts of Early-life Lead Exposure: Evidence from Changes in Vehicle Emissions in the United States [Part of Census RDC Project #2272]* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with Sam Arenberg </i></p>

<details>
 <summary> Project Summary </summary>
      <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> Beginning in the mid-1970s, airborne lead levels began to decrease sharply due to environmental regulation that reduced the content of lead in gasoline and the improved vehicle emissions technology. However, the long-run benefits of near-elimination of lead emissions on economic outcomes and racial equality are not well understood. This project utilizes restricted Census and Social Security data to link adult outcomes to exact place of birth and related lead exposure to assess the impact of the phaseout of leaded gasoline on human capital achievement, earnings, and other measures of well-being. </p>
